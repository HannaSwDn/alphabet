### I made this to practice commit messages :)

# Problems I had in this project:
First problem: Writing good commit messages.<br>
Second problem: How to get the time it took from where the user started to type in the input element, to when the user finished typing

# How I solved the problems:
First problem: I wrote many commits and I think they have gotten at least a little bit better after this project.<br>
Second problem: I first made a variable that would be the timer, and with setInterval I incremented it every tenth of a second.
